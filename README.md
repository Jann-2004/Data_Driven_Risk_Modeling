# 📊 Data Driven Risk Modeling

This repository showcases my work from the **J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program** on Forage. It includes a complete suite of real-world financial modeling simulations — from forecasting energy prices to predicting loan defaults and risk bucketing based on FICO scores.

## 🧠 What I Built

### 1️⃣ Time Series Forecasting
- Cleaned and visualized natural gas market data
- Used Holt-Winters exponential smoothing for 12-month price forecasting
- Built a pricing estimator to predict values for any given date (past or future)

### 2️⃣ Storage Contract Pricing Model
- Designed a financial model to assess the profitability of storing and trading gas over seasons
- Considered injection/withdrawal rates, storage capacity, storage cost, and market timing

### 3️⃣ Loan Default Prediction (PD & EL)
- Created machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict **Probability of Default**
- Built a custom `Expected Loss` calculator using real borrower info and assumptions
- Achieved strong model performance with high precision and recall

### 4️⃣ Mortgage Risk Bucketing with FICO Scores
- Applied KMeans clustering to bucket borrowers by FICO score
- Calculated and visualized default rates per bucket
- Delivered a more interpretable risk model for categorical architecture
